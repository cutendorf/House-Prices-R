# Machine Learning in R
## House Price Predictions from the King County data set

During my Master in Big Data and Data Analytics at IE Madrid I worked on the well known King County house price data set.

In order to access my results I provided two R markdowns. The first includes all my data exploration while the second one includes the predictive model. I tried several models including glmnet and ranger but xgboost outperformed them. As further steps I performed feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

The final predictions can be found in the data set folder.

Overall, the project follows a classical machine learning process (data exploration, data preparation, baseline, feature engineering, hyper parameter tuning, retraining).
